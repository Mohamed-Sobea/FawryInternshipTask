#  Fawry Internship Task

This project is a **simple object-oriented shopping system** developed in Java.  
It was built as part of the Fawry internship challenge, and it demonstrates the use of core **OOP principles**, including:

- **Abstraction** (through abstract base classes like `Product`)
- **Encapsulation** (private fields with public getters/setters)
- **Inheritance** (product types extending the base class)
- **Polymorphism** (overriding behavior like `isExpired()` and `isShippable()`)

The system simulates a basic shopping flow with cart management, checkout logic, and shipping services.
---

##  Features

- Add different types of products to the cart
- Handle expired and non-shippable products
- Validate product quantity and customer balance
- Print a detailed checkout receipt
- Simulate shipping process
